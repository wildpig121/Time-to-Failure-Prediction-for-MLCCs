# Time-to-Failure-Prediction-for-MLCCs
Multi-layer Ceramic Capacitors (MLCCs) are essential in modern electronics, with recent advancements in design and miniaturization leading to increased capacitance. However, these developments also bring challenges in long-term reliability, especially under extreme conditions like high electric fields and elevated temperatures. While existing research largely focuses on predicting the mean time to failure (MTTF) for MLCC populations, studies on predicting the time to failure (TTF) for individual capacitors are scarce. This study addresses this gap by developing a machine learning model to predict the TTF of individual MLCC. Using features extracted from current curves and failure data generated via Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT), we applied feature engineering and model optimization to select a Random Forest model, achieving an R2 of 0.89. This approach enables real-time monitoring and prediction of individual capacitor failures, offering valuable insights for improving reliability, particularly in the predictive maintenance of critical systems.
